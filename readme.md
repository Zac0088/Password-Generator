## Password Generator Challenge
# Description #
My third challenge for this course was to create a random password generator that met a certain criteria, so that a strong password could be created.
I tried various different approaches to this challenge and had to regear a few times, and still couldnt quiet reach the desired result. I managed to generate a random password but could not get the character choice parameters to work. I also ended up with alot of if/else statements witch need to be refinded with better use of logical comparison operators.
Although i was not completely succesful with this project im looking at it as a what not to do for my next challenge and hopefully excel.

# Acceptance Criteria #
